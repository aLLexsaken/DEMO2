            <h2>Who was Tolkien?</h2>
            <div class="biography-img">
                <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892–1973) was a major scholar of the English language, specialising in
                    Old
                    and Middle English. Twice Professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at the University of Oxford, he
                    also
                    wrote a number of stories, including most famously The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings
                    (1954–1955), which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version of our world which he called
                    by
                    the Middle English name of Middle-earth. This was peopled by Men (and women), Elves, Dwarves,
                    Trolls,
                    Orcs (or Goblins) and of course Hobbits. He has regularly been condemned by the Eng. Lit.
                    establishment,
                    with honourable exceptions, but loved by literally millions of readers worldwide.

                    In the 1960s he was taken up by many members of the nascent “counter-culture” largely because of his
                    concern with environmental issues. In 1997 he came top of three British polls, organised
                    respectively by
                    Channel 4 / Waterstone’s, the Folio Society, and SFX, the UK’s leading science fiction media
                    magazine,
                    amongst discerning readers asked to vote for the greatest book of the 20th century. Please note also
                    that his name is spelt Tolkien (there is no “Tolkein”).</p>

            <h2>Childhood and Youth</h2>
            <p>The name “Tolkien” (pron.: Tol-keen; equal stress on both syllables) was believed by the family
                (including Tolkien himself) to be of German origin; Toll-kühn: foolishly brave, or stupidly clever—hence
                the pseudonym “Oxymore” which he occasionally used; however, this quite probably was a German
                rationalisation of an originally Baltic Tolkyn, or Tolkīn. In any case, his great-great grandfather John
                (Johann) Benjamin Tolkien came to Britain with his brother Daniel from Gdańsk in about 1772 and rapidly
                became thoroughly Anglicised. Certainly his father, Arthur Reuel Tolkien, considered himself nothing if
                not English. Arthur was a bank clerk, and went to South Africa in the 1890s for better prospects of
                promotion. There he was joined by his bride, Mabel Suffield, whose family were not only English through
                and through, but West Midlands since time immemorial. So John Ronald (“Ronald” to family and early
                friends) was born in Bloemfontein, S.A., on 3 January 1892. His memories of Africa were slight but
                vivid, including a scary encounter with a large hairy spider, and influenced his later writing to some
                extent; slight, because on 15 February 1896 his father died, and he, his mother and his younger brother
                Hilary returned to England<span class="st">—</span>or more particularly, the West Midlands.</p>
            <p>The West Midlands in Tolkien’s childhood were a complex mixture of the grimly industrial Birmingham
                conurbation, and the quintessentially rural stereotype of England, Worcestershire and surrounding areas:
                Severn country, the land of the composers Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Gurney, and more distantly the
                poet A. E. Housman (it is also just across the border from Wales). Tolkien’s life was split between
                these two: the then very rural hamlet of Sarehole, with its mill, just south of Birmingham; and darkly
                urban Birmingham itself, where he was eventually sent to King Edward’s School. By then the family had
                moved to King’s Heath, where the house backed onto a railway line<span class="st">—</span>young Ronald’s
                developing linguistic imagination was engaged by the sight of coal trucks going to and from South Wales
                bearing destinations like” Nantyglo”,” Penrhiwceiber” and “Senghenydd”.</p>
            <p>Then they moved to the somewhat more pleasant Birmingham suburb of Edgbaston. However, in the meantime,
                something of profound significance had occurred, which estranged Mabel and her children from both sides
                of the family: in 1900, together with her sister May, she was received into the Roman Catholic Church.
                From then on, both Ronald and Hilary were brought up in the faith of Pio Nono, and remained devout
                Catholics throughout their lives. The parish priest who visited the family regularly was the
                half-Spanish half-Welsh Father Francis Morgan.</p>
            <p>Tolkien family life was generally lived on the genteel side of poverty. However, the situation worsened
                in 1904, when Mabel Tolkien was diagnosed as having diabetes, usually fatal in those pre-insulin days.
                She died on 14 November of that year leaving the two orphaned boys effectively destitute. At this point
                Father Francis took over, and made sure of the boys’ material as well as spiritual welfare, although in
                the short term they were boarded with an unsympathetic aunt-by-marriage, Beatrice Suffield, and then
                with a Mrs Faulkner.</p>
            <p>By this time Ronald was already showing remarkable linguistic gifts. He had mastered the Latin and Greek
                which was the staple fare of an arts education at that time, and was becoming more than competent in a
                number of other languages, both modern and ancient, notably Gothic, and later Finnish. He was already
                busy making up his own languages, purely for fun. He had also made a number of close friends at King
                Edward’s; in his later years at school they met regularly after hours as the “T. C. B. S.” (Tea Club,
                Barrovian Society, named after their meeting place at the Barrow Stores) and they continued to
                correspond closely and exchange and criticise each other’s literary work until 1916.</p>
            <p>However, another complication had arisen. Amongst the lodgers at Mrs Faulkner’s boarding house was a
                young woman called Edith Bratt. When Ronald was 16, and she 19, they struck up a friendship, which
                gradually deepened. Eventually Father Francis took a hand, and forbade Ronald to see or even correspond
                with Edith for three years, until he was 21. Ronald stoically obeyed this injunction to the letter. In
                the summer of 1911, he was invited to join a party on a walking holiday in Switzerland, which may have
                inspired his descriptions of the Misty Mountains, and of Rivendell. In the autumn of that year he went
                up to Exeter College, Oxford where he stayed, immersing himself in the Classics, Old English, the
                Germanic languages (especially Gothic), Welsh and Finnish, until 1913, when he swiftly though not
                without difficulty picked up the threads of his relationship with Edith. He then obtained a
                disappointing second class degree in Honour Moderations, the “midway” stage of a 4-year Oxford “Greats”
                (i.e. Classics) course, although with an “alpha plus” in philology. As a result of this he changed his
                school from Classics to the more congenial English Language and Literature. One of the poems he
                discovered in the course of his Old English studies was the <i>Crist</i> of Cynewulf<span
                    class="st">—</span>he was amazed especially by the cryptic couplet:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Eálá Earendel engla beorhtast</p>
                <p>Ofer middangeard monnum sended</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Which translates as:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><i>Hail Earendel brightest of angels,</i></p>
                <p>over Middle Earth sent to men.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>(“<i>Middangeard</i>” was an ancient expression for the everyday world between Heaven above and Hell
                below.)</p>
            <p>This inspired some of his very early and inchoate attempts at realising a world of ancient beauty in his
                versifying.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1913 he took a job as tutor and escort to two Mexican boys in Dinard, France, a job
                which ended in tragedy. Though no fault of Ronald’s, it did nothing to counter his apparent
                predisposition against France and things French.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the relationship with Edith was going more smoothly. She converted to Catholicism and moved to
                Warwick, which with its spectacular castle and beautiful surrounding countryside made a great impression
                on Ronald. However, as the pair were becoming ever closer, the nations were striving ever more furiously
                together, and war eventually broke out in August 1914.</p>
            <h2>War, Lost Tales and Academia</h2>
            <p>Unlike so many of his contemporaries, Tolkien did not rush to join up immediately on the outbreak of war,
                but returned to Oxford, where he worked hard and finally achieved a first-class degree in June 1915. At
                this time he was also working on various poetic attempts, and on his invented languages, especially one
                that he came to call Qenya [<i>sic</i>], which was heavily influenced by Finnish<span
                    class="st">—</span>but he still felt the lack of a connecting thread to bring his vivid but
                disparate imaginings together. Tolkien finally enlisted as a second lieutenant in the Lancashire
                Fusiliers whilst working on ideas of Earendel [<i>sic</i>] the Mariner, who became a star, and his
                journeyings. For many months Tolkien was kept in boring suspense in England, mainly in Staffordshire.
                Finally it appeared that he must soon embark for France, and he and Edith married in Warwick on 22 March
                1916.</p>
            <p>Eventually he was indeed sent to active duty on the Western Front, just in time for the Somme offensive.
                After four months in and out of the trenches, he succumbed to “trench fever”, a form of typhus-like
                infection common in the insanitary conditions, and in early November was sent back to England, where he
                spent the next month in hospital in Birmingham. By Christmas he had recovered sufficiently to stay with
                Edith at Great Haywood in Staffordshire.</p>
            <p>During these last few months, all but one of his close friends of the “T. C. B. S.” had been killed in
                action. Partly as an act of piety to their memory, but also stirred by reaction against his war
                experiences, he had already begun to put his stories into shape, “<i>… in huts full of blasphemy and
                    smut, or by candle light in bell-tents, even some down in dugouts under shell fire</i>”
                [<i>Letters</i> 66]. This ordering of his imagination developed into the <i>Book of Lost Tales</i> (not
                published in his lifetime), in which most of the major stories of the Silmarillion appear in their first
                form: tales of the Elves and the “Gnomes”, (i. e. Deep Elves, the later Noldor), with their languages
                Qenya and Goldogrin. Here are found the first recorded versions of the wars against Morgoth, the siege
                and fall of Gondolin and Nargothrond, and the tales of Túrin and of Beren and Lúthien.</p>
            <p>Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, although periods of remission enabled him to do home
                service at various camps sufficiently well to be promoted to lieutenant. It was when he was stationed in
                the Hull area that he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and there in a grove thick
                with hemlock Edith danced for him. This was the inspiration for the tale of Beren and Lúthien, a
                recurrent theme in his “Legendarium”. He came to think of Edith as “Lúthien” and himself as “Beren”.
                Their first son, John Francis Reuel (later Father John Tolkien) had already been born on 16 November
                1917.</p>
            <p>When the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, Tolkien had already been putting out feelers to obtain
                academic employment, and by the time he was demobilised he had been appointed Assistant Lexicographer on
                the New English Dictionary (the “Oxford English Dictionary”), then in preparation. While doing the
                serious philological work involved in this, he also gave one of his <i>Lost Tales</i> its first public
                airing<span class="st">—</span>he read <i>The Fall of Gondolin</i> to the Exeter College Essay Club,
                where it was well received by an audience which included Neville Coghill and Hugo Dyson, two future
                “Inklings”. However, Tolkien did not stay in this job for long. In the summer of 1920 he applied for the
                quite senior post of Reader (approximately, Associate Professor) in English Language at the University
                of Leeds, and to his surprise was appointed.</p>
            <p>At Leeds as well as teaching he collaborated with E. V. Gordon on the famous edition of <i>Sir Gawain and
                    the Green Knight</i>, and continued writing and refining <i>The Book of Lost Tales</i> and his
                invented “Elvish” languages. In addition, he and Gordon founded a “Viking Club” for undergraduates
                devoted mainly to reading Old Norse sagas and drinking beer. It was for this club that he and Gordon
                originally wrote their <i>Songs for the Philologists</i>, a mixture of traditional songs and original
                verses translated into Old English, Old Norse and Gothic to fit traditional English tunes. Leeds also
                saw the birth of two more sons: Michael Hilary Reuel in October 1920, and Christopher Reuel in 1924.
                Then in 1925 the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford fell vacant; Tolkien
                successfully applied for the post.</p>
            <h2>Professor Tolkien, The Inklings and Hobbits</h2>
            <p>In a sense, in returning to Oxford as a Professor, Tolkien had come home. Although he had few illusions
                about the academic life as a haven of unworldly scholarship (see for example <i>Letters</i> 250), he was
                nevertheless by temperament a don’s don, and fitted extremely well into the largely male world of
                teaching, research, the comradely exchange of ideas and occasional publication. In fact, his academic
                publication record is very sparse, something that would have been frowned upon in these days of
                quantitative personnel evaluation.</p>
            <p>However, his rare scholarly publications were often extremely influential, most notably his lecture
                “Beowulf, the Monsters and the Critics”. His seemingly almost throwaway comments have sometimes helped
                to transform the understanding of a particular field<span class="st">—</span>for example, in his essay
                on “English and Welsh”, with its explanation of the origins of the term “Welsh” and its references to
                phonaesthetics (both these pieces are collected in <i>The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays</i>,
                currently in print). His academic life was otherwise largely unremarkable. In 1945 he changed his chair
                to the Merton Professorship of English Language and Literature, which he retained until his retirement
                in 1959. Apart from all the above, he taught undergraduates, and played an important but unexceptional
                part in academic politics and administration.</p>
            <p>His family life was equally straightforward. Edith bore their last child and only daughter, Priscilla, in
                1929. Tolkien got into the habit of writing the children annual illustrated letters as if from Santa
                Claus, and a selection of these was published in 1976 as <i>The Father Christmas Letters</i>. He also
                told them numerous bedtime stories, of which more anon. In adulthood John entered the priesthood,
                Michael and Christopher both saw war service in the Royal Air Force. Afterwards Michael became a
                schoolmaster and Christopher a university lecturer, and Priscilla became a social worker. They lived
                quietly in North Oxford, and later Ronald and Edith lived in the suburb of Headington.</p>
            <p>However, Tolkien’s social life was far from unremarkable. He soon became one of the founder members of a
                loose grouping of Oxford friends (by no means all at the University) with similar interests, known as
                “The Inklings”. The origins of the name were purely facetious—it had to do with writing, and sounded
                mildly Anglo-Saxon; there was no evidence that members of the group claimed to have an “inkling” of the
                Divine Nature, as is sometimes suggested. Other prominent members included the above—mentioned Messrs
                Coghill and Dyson, as well as Owen Barfield, Charles Williams, and above all C. S. Lewis, who became one
                of Tolkien’s closest friends, and for whose return to Christianity Tolkien was at least partly
                responsible. The Inklings regularly met for conversation, drink, and frequent reading from their
                work-in-progress.</p>
            <h2>The Storyteller</h2>
            <p>Meanwhile Tolkien continued developing his mythology and languages. As mentioned above, he told his
                children stories, some of which he developed into those published posthumously as <i>Mr. Bliss</i>,
                <i>Roverandom</i>, etc. However, according to his own account, one day when he was engaged in the
                soul-destroying task of marking examination papers, he discovered that one candidate had left one page
                of an answer-book blank. On this page, moved by who knows what anarchic daemon, he wrote “<i>In a hole
                    in the ground there lived a hobbit</i>“.</p>
            <p>In typical Tolkien fashion, he then decided he needed to find out what a Hobbit was, what sort of a hole
                it lived in, why it lived in a hole, etc. From this investigation grew a tale that he told to his
                younger children, and even passed round. In 1936 an incomplete typescript of it came into the hands of
                Susan Dagnall, an employee of the publishing firm of George Allen and Unwin (merged in 1990 with
                HarperCollins).</p>
            <p>She asked Tolkien to finish it, and presented the complete story to Stanley Unwin, the then Chairman of
                the firm. He tried it out on his 10-year old son Rayner, who wrote an approving report, and it was
                published as <i>The Hobbit </i>in 1937. It immediately scored a success, and has not been out of
                children’s recommended reading lists ever since. It was so successful that Stanley Unwin asked if he had
                any more similar material available for publication.</p>
            <p>By this time Tolkien had begun to make his Legendarium into what he believed to be a more presentable
                state, and as he later noted, hints of it had already made their way into <i>The Hobbit</i>. He was now
                calling the full account <i>Quenta Silmarillion</i>, or <i>Silmarillion</i> for short. He presented some
                of his “completed” tales to Unwin, who sent them to his reader. The reader’s reaction was mixed: dislike
                of the poetry and praise for the prose (the material was the story of Beren and Lúthien) but the overall
                decision at the time was that these were not commercially publishable. Unwin tactfully relayed this
                message to Tolkien, but asked him again if he was willing to write a sequel to <i>The Hobbit</i>.
                Tolkien was disappointed at the apparent failure of <i>The Silmarillion</i>, but agreed to take up the
                challenge of “The New Hobbit”.</p>
            <p>This soon developed into something much more than a children’s story; for the highly complex 16-year
                history of what became <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> consult the works listed below. Suffice it to say
                that the now adult Rayner Unwin was deeply involved in the later stages of this opus, dealing
                magnificently with a dilatory and temperamental author who, at one stage, was offering the whole work to
                a commercial rival (which rapidly backed off when the scale and nature of the package became apparent).
                It is thanks to Rayner Unwin’s advocacy that we owe the fact that this book was published at all –
                <i>Andave laituvalmes</i>! His father’s firm decided to incur the probable loss of £1,000 for the
                <i>succès d’estime</i>, and publish it under the title of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> in three parts
                during 1954 and 1955, with USA rights going to Houghton Mifflin. It soon became apparent that both
                author and publishers had greatly underestimated the work’s public appeal.</p>
            <h2>The “Cult”</h2>
            <p><i></i>The Lord of the Rings rapidly came to public notice. It had mixed reviews, ranging from the
                ecstatic (W. H. Auden, C. S. Lewis) to the damning (E. Wilson, E. Muir, P. Toynbee) and just about
                everything in between. The BBC put on a drastically condensed radio adaptation in 12 episodes on the
                Third Programme. In 1956 radio was still a dominant medium in Britain, and the Third Programme was the
                “intellectual” channel. So far from losing money, sales so exceeded the break-even point as to make
                Tolkien regret that he had not taken early retirement. However, this was still based only upon hardback
                sales.</p>
            <p>The really amazing moment was when <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> went into a pirated paperback version in
                1965. Firstly, this put the book into the impulse-buying category; and secondly, the publicity generated
                by the copyright dispute alerted millions of American readers to the existence of something outside
                their previous experience, but which appeared to speak to their condition. By 1968 <i>The Lord of the
                    Rings</i> had almost become the Bible of the “Alternative Society”.</p>
            <p>This development produced mixed feelings in the author. On the one hand, he was extremely flattered, and
                to his amazement, became rather rich. On the other, he could only deplore those whose idea of a great
                trip was to ingest <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and LSD simultaneously. Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley
                Kubrick had similar experiences with <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. Fans were causing increasing
                problems; both those who came to gawp at his house and those, especially from California who telephoned
                at 7 p.m. (their time—3 a.m. his), to demand to know whether Frodo had succeeded or failed in the Quest,
                what was the preterite of Quenyan <i>lanta</i>-, or whether or not Balrogs had wings. So he changed
                addresses, his telephone number went ex-directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, a
                pleasant but uninspiring South Coast resort (Hardy’s “Sandbourne”), noted for the number of its elderly
                well-to-do residents.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the cult, not just of Tolkien, but of the fantasy literature that he had revived, if not
                actually inspired (to his dismay), was really taking off—but that is another story, to be told in
                another place.</p>
            <h2>Other Writings</h2>
            <p>Despite all the fuss over <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, between 1925 and his death Tolkien did write and
                publish a number of other articles, including a range of scholarly essays, many reprinted in <i>The
                    Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays</i> (see above); one Middle-earth related work, <i>The
                    Adventures of Tom Bombadil</i>; editions and translations of Middle English works such as the
                <i>Ancrene Wisse</i>, <i>Sir Gawain</i>, <i>Sir Orfeo</i> and <i>The Pearl</i>, and some stories
                independent of the Legendarium, such as the <i>Imram</i>, <i>The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm’s
                    Son</i>, <i>The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun</i>—and, especially, <i>Farmer Giles of Ham</i>, <i>Leaf by
                    Niggle</i>, and <i>Smith of Wootton Major</i>.</p>
            <p>The flow of publications was only temporarily slowed by Tolkien’s death. The long-awaited
                <i>Silmarillion</i>, edited by Christopher Tolkien, appeared in 1977. In 1980 Christopher also published
                a selection of his father’s incomplete writings from his later years under the title of <i>Unfinished
                    Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth</i>. In the introduction to this work Christopher Tolkien referred
                in passing to <i>The Book of Lost Tales</i>, “itself a very substantial work, of the utmost interest to
                one concerned with the origins of Middle-earth, but requiring to be presented in a lengthy and complex
                study, if at all” (<i>Unfinished Tales</i>, p. 6, paragraph 1).</p>
            <p>The sales of <i>The Silmarillion</i> had rather taken George Allen &amp; Unwin by surprise, and those of
                <i>Unfinished Tales</i> even more so. Obviously, there was a market even for this relatively abstruse
                material and they decided to risk embarking on this “lengthy and complex study”. Even more lengthy and
                complex than expected, the resulting 12 volumes of the <i>History of Middle-earth</i>, under
                Christopher’s editorship, proved to be a successful enterprise. (Tolkien’s publishers had changed hands,
                and names, several times between the start of the enterprise in 1983 and the appearance of the paperback
                edition of Volume 12, <i>The Peoples of Middle-earth</i>, in 1997.) Over time, other posthumous
                publications emerged including <em>Roverandom</em> (1998), <em>The Children of Húrin</em> (2007),
                <em>Beowulf</em> (2014), <em>Beren and Lúthien</em> (2017), and most recently <em>The Fall of
                    Gondolin</em> (2018).</p>
            <h2>Finish</h2>
            <p>After his retirement in 1959 Edith and Ronald moved to Bournemouth. On 29 November 1971 Edith died, and
                Ronald soon returned to Oxford, to rooms provided by Merton College. Ronald died on 2 September 1973. He
                and Edith are buried together in a single grave in the Catholic section of Wolvercote cemetery in the
                northern suburbs of Oxford. (The grave is well signposted from the entrance.) The legend on the
                headstone reads:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Edith Mary Tolkien, Lúthien, 1889–1971</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, Beren, 1892–1973</p>
            </blockquote>
